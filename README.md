# Temperature-Based Water Flow Control System

## Overview

This project involves building a temperature-based water flow control system using a Raspberry Pi. The system utilizes a temperature sensor to measure temperature, and based on the temperature readings, it controls a relay module to manage water flow. 

Additionally, the project includes a machine learning model to predict water flow based on temperature data. The model is trained using both logistic regression and a neural network, and it is deployed using TensorFlow Lite for efficient inference on edge devices.

## Components

1. **Temperature Sensor**: Measures the temperature and sends data to the Raspberry Pi.
2. **Raspberry Pi**: Processes temperature data and controls the relay module.
3. **Relay Module**: Controls the water flow system based on signals from the Raspberry Pi.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Simulates temperature data and water flow based on a threshold (24Â°C).
   - Saves the simulated data to a CSV file.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loads and preprocesses the data for model training.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Logistic Regression and Neural Network models are trained to predict water flow based on temperature.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluates model performance using classification metrics.

5. **Model Deployment**:
   - Converts the neural network model to TensorFlow Lite format for efficient deployment.
   - Defines functions to predict water flow using the TensorFlow Lite model.

6. **Web Interface**:
   - A Streamlit app to interact with the model and visualize predictions.

7. **Email Alerts**:
   - Sends email alerts when the temperature falls below the threshold.

8. **Real-Time Prediction**:
   - Provides real-time predictions and visualizations based on user input.
